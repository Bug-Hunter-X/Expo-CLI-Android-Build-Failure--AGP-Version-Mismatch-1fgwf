This error occurs when using the Expo CLI to build an Android app and involves a mismatch between the Android Gradle Plugin (AGP) version used by the Expo project and the version required by the Android SDK or dependencies.  This might manifest in various ways, including build failures with messages about incompatible versions or missing dependencies. The problem might arise from outdated configurations or conflicting dependencies within the project, particularly when using external libraries or plugins that have their own AGP version requirements.
