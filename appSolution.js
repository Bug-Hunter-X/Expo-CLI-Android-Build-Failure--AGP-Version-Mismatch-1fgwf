The solution involves checking and potentially updating the `android/build.gradle` and `android/app/build.gradle` files to ensure compatibility. You might need to synchronize your Gradle wrapper to the latest stable version.  Updating Expo's SDK version can also resolve the issue in many cases.  For more precise solutions, it's often useful to carefully examine the full error message from the build process, as it usually points towards the specific incompatibility.
